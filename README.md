# Adventure_game

Welcome to Adventure Escape!

This is a fairly simple, linear adventure game that tells the story of a vagabond trying to escape from a medieval prison!

There are 5+1 bonus areas the adventurer needs to explore and escape, while trying to keep themselves healthy (and rich!)

Keep in mind there is no error checking, so the commands need to be followed careful, or the program will crash!

You have to follow the given instructions on how to proceed through every step. Each area has its own hurdles and objects/enemies that the player can interact with.

The visuals are given as rough indicators for what points of interest exist on every area, so use them to your advantage!
